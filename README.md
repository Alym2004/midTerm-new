The website uses a color scheme with various shades of red and black, providing a visually appealing contrast.
The header section has a dark background color (#333) with white text for better readability.

Images in the gallery section are styled to have a fixed width and height, maintaining aspect ratio while scaling appropriately on different screen sizes.
Navigation links are styled to have a consistent appearance throughout the website, with red color (#d81717) for better visibility.
